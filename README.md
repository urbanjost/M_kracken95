# M_kracken95

   A module that provides the Fortran 95 version of the kracken(3f)
   procedure (and related routines) for command line parsing. See the
   [kracken documentation](https://urbanjost.github.io/M_kracken95/krackenhelp.html) for a
   full description.

## Sample Usage

   ```fortran
       program krackentest
       use M_kracken95, only : kracken, iget, lget, rget, sget
       implicit none
       ! define command and default argument values and read command line arguments
         call kracken('cmd', ' -i 10 -r 10.0e3 -l .F. -f input')
       ! retrieve values as specified types and use them
         write(*,*)trim(sget('cmd_f')), iget('cmd_i'), lget('cmd_l'), rget('cmd_r')
       end program krackentest
   ```
   This program can now be called like
   ```bash
       ./krackentest -r 200 -i 123 -l -f myfile.txt
   ```

## Download and Build
   Just download the github repository, enter the src/ directory and run make:
   
   ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/urbanjost/M_kracken95.git
        cd M_kracken95/src
        # change Makefile if not using one of the listed compilers
     
        # for gfortran
        make clean
        make F90=gfortran gfortran
     
        # for ifort
        make clean
        make F90=ifort ifort

        # for nvfortran
        make clean
        make F90=nvfortran nvfortran
   ```
   
   This will compile the M_kracken95 module and build all the example
   programs.  Then you can run the examples:
   
         ../test/test1/kracken_test-1 -r 1234.56
         ../test/test2/kracken_test-2 --help
         ../test/test3/kracken_test-3 --par3 100 200 300
   
## Supports FPM ![fpm](docs/images/fpm_logo.gif)
#### (registered at the [fpm(1) registry](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm-registry) )

   Alternatively, download the github repository and build it with 
   fpm ( as described at [Fortran Package Manager](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm) )
   
   ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/urbanjost/M_kracken95.git
        cd M_kracken95
        fpm build
        fpm test
   ```
   
   or just list it as a dependency in your fpm.toml project file.
   
```toml
        [dependencies]
        M_kracken95        = { git = "https://github.com/urbanjost/M_kracken95.git" }
```

## Which version of kracken(3f) is this?

   There are multiple versions of the kracken(3f) routine dating back
   to the late 1980s that conform to various Fortran standards. This is
   the one that adheres to the Fortran 95 Standard except for the use of
   the routines command_argument_count(3f) and get_command_argument(3f),
   which are part of Fortran 2003 (Fortran 95 has no standard intrinsic
   for reading command line arguments but the vast majority of compilers
   have some routine for doing so as an extension).
   
   The main disadvantage of this version versus f2003+ versions is that
   constant values are used to specify the maxiumum number of parameters and
   the length of the parameters (if you know you have the f2003+ routines
   for getting command arguments this can be easily changed so that you
   scan the argument lengths in the first pass and then allocate them and
   use them in the second pass).
   
   But since newer versions already exist that take advantage of Fortran
   2003 this version is considered frozen. Since it is still requested it
   will remain available as-is.

## If you are having problems

   The routine GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENTS() is the only one that uses non-f95
   standard routines to read from the command line. If you do not have a
   compiler that supports these f2003 procedures you may have to change that
   procedure to make calls to the equivalent common extensions GETARGS()
   and IARGC(). Note that as of this date it is very likely you can get
   a GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT() look-alike from the free F2KCLI package from
   WINTERACTER if your compiler does not support it.
   
   You may note that the command parsing rules are not identical to Unix,
   although very similar. This is intentional so that quotes are rarely
   needed when entering commands and so negative values can be entered
   without quoting. The main differences are there is no way to terminate
   a keyword except by starting a new keyword; and the default keyword
   -oo described later is implied after the verb; and you cannot combine
   keywords (-ir is not equivalent to -i -r, which is sometimes allowed on
   Unix commands). You may find the way to include a literal double-quote
   character (") as part of an input value is the most unlike Unix (*Hint*:
   Double the double-quote. See code comments for details).
